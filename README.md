### PRACTICALS

This folder contains notebooks based on the Module lectures, and are centered around different topics related to Machine Learning. The main part of each notebook are the exercises, done as weekly assignments for the Module. The rest of the notebooks is heavily based on the lectures, with certain parts being left out or further developed, to build a narrative around the mentioned exercises. Below are listed all the notebooks and a brief explanation of each exercise.

#### 01 - STATISTICS

There are three exercises in this notebook. First two are centered around A Lady Tea Test, and the third one around Student T-test.
- Exercise 1 - Calculate the minimum number of cups of tea required to ensure the probability of randomly selecting the correct cups is less than or equal to 1%
    - Bonus: How many would be required if you were to let the taster get one cup wrong while maintaining the 1% threshold?
- Exercise 2 - Use scipy's version of Fisher's exact test to simulate the Lady Tasting Tea problem.
- Exercise 3 - Take the code from the Examples section of the scipy stats documentation for independent samples t-tests and explain how it works.

#### 02 - MODELS

There are 

- Exercise 1 - Plot the absolute value function. Research and explain why the absolute value function is not typically used in fitting straight lines to data.
- Exercise 2 - Fit a straight line to the given data points, using numpy.polyfit, scipy.optimize.minimize and scipy.optimize.curve_fit. Is a straight line a good model for these points?

#### 03 - PARAMETERS

- Exercise 1 - Use numpy's polyfit to fit polynomials to the given data sets.

#### 04 - LEARNING

- No Exercises

### FINAL ASSESMENT

#### 05 - ANOMALY_DETECTION
